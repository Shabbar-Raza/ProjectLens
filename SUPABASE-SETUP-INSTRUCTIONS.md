# ðŸš€ Supabase Database Setup for Project Lens

## Step 1: Copy the SQL Schema

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://app.supabase.com
   - Navigate to your project: https://shffdhiyivwxzrarkquf.supabase.co

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Execute the Schema**
   - Copy the ENTIRE content from `supabase-database-schema.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

## Step 2: Verify Setup

After running the SQL, you should see:

```sql
-- Run this to verify tables were created:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('users', 'user_subscriptions', 'usage_logs', 'payments', 'project_analyses');
```

Expected output:
- users
- user_subscriptions  
- usage_logs
- payments
- project_analyses

## Step 3: Test the System

1. **Sign up for a new account** in your app
2. **Check if user was created automatically:**

```sql
-- Check users table
SELECT id, email, full_name, created_at FROM users;

-- Check subscriptions table  
SELECT user_id, plan_type, usage_count, usage_limit, status FROM user_subscriptions;
```

## Step 4: Test Usage Tracking

```sql
-- Test the usage function
SELECT increment_usage_count(
  'your-user-id-here'::uuid, 
  'analysis', 
  'Test Project', 
  10
);

-- Check usage was recorded
SELECT * FROM usage_logs WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id-here';
```

## Step 5: Test Upgrade Function

```sql
-- Test upgrade to pro
SELECT upgrade_user_to_pro('your-user-id-here'::uuid);

-- Verify upgrade
SELECT plan_type, usage_limit FROM user_subscriptions 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id-here';
```

- âœ… **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
- âœ… Users can only access their own data
- âœ… Service role can manage all data (for webhooks)
- âœ… Automatic user profile creation on signup

### âš¡ Functions Created:

- `increment_usage_count()` - Safely increment usage
- `can_use_feature()` - Check if user has remaining usage
- `upgrade_user_to_pro()` - Upgrade user subscription
- `handle_new_user()` - Auto-create profiles on signup

### ðŸ”„ Triggers Created:

- Auto-create user profile and free subscription on signup
- Auto-update `updated_at` timestamps

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tables not created
**Solution:** Make sure you copied the ENTIRE SQL file content

### Issue: RLS blocking queries  
**Solution:** Check if you're authenticated in your app

### Issue: Trigger not working
**Solution:** Verify the trigger exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
```

### Issue: Functions not working
**Solution:** Check function exists:
```sql
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name = 'increment_usage_count';
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Database schema created
2. ðŸ”„ Test user registration
3. ðŸ”„ Set up Stripe integration  
4. ðŸ”„ Configure environment variables
5. ðŸ”„ Test payment flow

Your Project Lens database is now ready! ðŸŽ‰
